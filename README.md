# Movie_Recommendation_system_collaborative_filtering
Movie Recommendation System Collaborative Filtering Task 2 Bharat Intern

This repository implements a movie recommendation system built on collaborative filtering techniques.
It utilizes the powerful libraries of Python, including:

* **Numpy:** Enables efficient numerical computations for data manipulation.
* **Pandas:** Provides essential tools for data analysis and processing.
* **Scikit-learn:** Offers various machine learning algorithms, including those for collaborative filtering.
* **Streamlit:** Creates user-friendly web applications, bringing your recommendation system to life.

### Collaborative Filtering Explained

Collaborative filtering thrives on the power of user preferences. It analyzes user ratings and identifies users with similar tastes, recommending movies they're likely to enjoy based on those shared preferences. This project employs matrix factorization, a technique that uncovers hidden patterns in user-movie interactions, represented as a matrix.

### Data Fueling the Recommendations

The system draws its recommendations from a movie rating dataset. This data, containing user ratings on various movies, forms the foundation for building the user-item rating matrix and extracting those crucial hidden patterns.
